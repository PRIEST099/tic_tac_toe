# Tic Tac Toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe Game Created with Flutter / Dart.

## Why tic tac toe

I built this project when i was learning about some of the AI algorithms ( Specifically Minimax algorithm ).

### What is Minimax algorithm:

Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin" â€“ to maximize the minimum gain. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

## Features

- **AI Oponent**: Unbeaten AI algorithm due to its optimal decision-making.
- **Two Player Mode**: Challenge a friend in a classsic two player game.
- **Simple UI**: definitely gotta be something extra to add on ...

## How it works
The game utilizes the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI. This algorithm evaluates all possible future moves and selects the one that maximizes the AIâ€™s chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances.
